I pursued this project for fun as an excuse to learn more about probability/statistics, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Attached are my notebooks where I did all of the building. I used two online guides to help with the AE/VAE sections, which are linked below:
